# Day 12: Python variables

Variables store data in Python.

## Examples:
```python
name = "Your Name"
commits = 12
days_completed = 12
goal = 50

print(f"{name} has made {commits} commits")
print(f"Goal: {goal}, Progress: {days_completed}/{goal}")
```

## What I learned:
- Variables can store numbers and text
- f-strings show variable values
- Python makes it simple

## Progress: 12/50 commits
