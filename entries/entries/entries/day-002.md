# Day 2: Learning about commits

Today I learned how commits work in Git.
A commit is like a snapshot of my project at a specific time.

## What I did:
- Created my first files
- Learned about commit messages
- Made 5 commits so far

## What I learned:
- Commit messages should be clear
- `feat:` is for new features
- `docs:` is for documentation

## Progress: 6/50 commits
