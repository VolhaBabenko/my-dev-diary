# Day 1: Starting the journey

Today I started my 50-day developer diary project.
I created the repository and set up the basic structure.

## What I learned:
- How to create a GitHub repository
- How to initialize a project
- How to write in Markdown

## Goals for tomorrow:
- Add more structure
- Write about Git basics
